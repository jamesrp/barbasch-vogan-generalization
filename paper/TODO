1.1
first paragraph, add references about lifts to the first paragraph,
e.g. yannakakis for LP and gouveia-parrillo-thomas for sdp lifts.
second paragraph, at the beginning mention that we are interested in
whether LP or SDP lifts are as strong as polytime computations. (For
NP problems we don't expect small lifts. - move this from third
paragraph). Until Rothvoss paper, everything in P that we knew of had
a small lift. drum up rothvoss result.
third pp-we can ask all the same questions for sdp. sdp lifts of match
is the major open ptoblem at this pt. work in this paper is 1st step.

1.2 add a paragraph of how pp1 applies to matching sdp lifts, define bn etc.
