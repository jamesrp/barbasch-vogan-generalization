1.1
first paragraph, add references about lifts to the first paragraph,
e.g. yannakakis for LP and gouveia-parrillo-thomas for sdp lifts.
Mention theta body.
second paragraph, at the beginning mention that we are interested in
whether LP or SDP lifts are as strong as polytime computations. (For
NP problems we don't expect small lifts. - move this from third
paragraph). Until Rothvoss paper, everything in P that we knew of had
a small lift. drum up rothvoss result.

read by myself to see if it's convincing. after edits send to rekha
and monty and greg to read.
