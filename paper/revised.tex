\begin{abstract}
We give a concrete decomposition of the coset representation of the hyperoctahedral group, following Barbasch and Vogan \cite{bv}.
We define two natural generalizations of the hyperoctahedral group, and extend the proof in \cite{bv} to recursively compute these decompositions.
Although the decompositions do not appear to follow a simple pattern, we prove enough of their structure to show that they are almost never multiplicity-free.
These algebraic results are a first step in deciding whether the matching polytope has a small invariant semidefinite lift.

\section{Introduction} \label{BV:Introduction}

A lift of a polytope $P \subseteq \RR^n$ is an object $Q \subseteq \RR^m$ together with a linear map $L: \RR^m \to \RR^n$ such that $L(Q) = P$.
Usually we choose a $Q$ over which we can efficiently optimize linear functions.
This then gives a procedure for optimizing linear functions over $P$, which bounds the complexity of optimizing over $P$.
Two important examples are LP (linear) lifts, in which $Q$ is again a polytope, and SDP (semidefinite) lifts, in which $Q$ is the feasible region of a semidefinite program.
We often have that $P$ is invariant under a group $G$.
In this case, we say the lift is {\em invariant} if $G$ preserves $Q$ and commutes with $L$.
For a given polytope, we are interested in whether a small SDP or LP lift exists, and if so, whether it can be made invariant.
For background on LP lifts, see Yannakakis \cite{yannakakis1988expressing}.
For background on SDP lifts, see Gouveia, Parrilo, and Thomas \cite{gpt}.

We can ask whether LP or SDP lifts capture all the computational power of polynomial-time computation.
That is, given that a combinatorial optimization problem is in P, does the associated family of polytopes have small lifts?
(For NP-hard problems we don't expect small lifts unless P = NP.)
A central example is the {\em matching polytope} $\MATCH_n$, given by the convex hull of characteristic vectors of perfect matchings in the complete graph $K_{2n}$.
Since the maximum matching problem is in P, it is reasonable that there be a small lift of $\MATCH_n$.
However, Yannakakis \cite{yannakakis1988expressing} proved that $\MATCH_n$ has no small invariant LP lift.
Kaibel, Pashkovich, and Theis \cite{kaibel2010symmetry} found examples of slices of $\MATCH_n$ for which there is a small lift but no small invariant lift.
Rothvoss \cite{rothvoss2013matching} showed that $\MATCH_n$ has no small LP lift.
This was a groundbreaking result as it was the first example of a problem in P which provably has no small lift.

We can ask all the above problems about SDP lifts.
The {\em cut polytope} $\CUT_n$ is the convex hull of characteristic vectors of cuts in $K_{n}$.
Since the max cut problem is NP-complete, we don't expect a small lift of $\CUT_n$, and that is what has recently been shown.
Fawzi, Saunderson, and Parrilo \cite{fawzi2014equivariant} and Lee, Raghavendra, Steurer, and Tan \cite{lee2014power}, using slightly different group actions, proved that $\CUT_n$ has no small invariant SDP lift.
Lee, Raghavendra, and Steurer \cite{lee2014lower} proved that $\CUT_n$ has no small SDP lift.
There are currently no results about small SDP lifts of $\MATCH_n$, invariant or otherwise.
This is the major open problem in the area today; this work in this paper provides a first step to showing lower bounds of SDP representations of $\MATCH_n$.

An important tool for analyzing an invariant semidefinite program is block diagonalization.
If an SDP is invariant under a group action, it can be brought into block diagonal form by decomposing the underlying space into $G$-modules; see Vallentin \cite{vallentin2009symmetry} for a tutorial.
Applied to SDP lifts, this gives a method for determining the size of the smallest invariant SDP lift for a given polytope.
In this paper, we give an explicit decomposition for $S_{2n}$ acting on the matching polytope.
Such a decomposition is a first step in finding the smallest invariant SDP lift for the matching polytope.



Let $B_n \subseteq S_{2n}$ be the {\em hyperoctahedral group}; that is, the stabilizer of $\sigma = (12)(34)\ldots (2n-1,2n)$ in $S_{2n}$.
Barbasch and Vogan \cite{bv} showed that the induced representation $\Ind_{B_n}^{S_{2n}}(1)$ decomposes into a sum of Specht modules $\oplus_\lambda S^\lambda$, one for each $\lambda \vdash 2n$ such that each $\lambda_i$ is even.
The $S_{2n}$-module $\Ind_{B_n}^{S_{2n}}(1)$ is naturally isomorphic to the vector space of perfect matchings on $K_{2n}$.
Decomposing this vector space into irreducible representations corresponds to a block diagonalization of the semidefinite program underlying the sum of squares lift for these matchings.

We define two subgroups $C_{m,n}$ and $D_{m,n}$ of $S_{mn}$, each of which is a natural generalization of $B_n$.
Let $C_{m,n} = S_n \wreath S_m$ and $D_{m,n} = S_n \wreath C_m$.
Here $C_m \subseteq S_m$ is the cyclic group generated by an $m$-cycle.
When $m=2$, $C_{m,n} = D_{m,n} = B_n$.
These subgroups arise naturally when using symmetry to reduce the dimension of semidefinite programs in combinatorial optimization.
The $S_{mn}$-module $\Ind_{C_{m,n}}^{S_{mn}}(1)$ is naturally isomorphic to the vector space of perfect $m$-uniform hypermatchings on the $m$-uniform complete hypergraph $K^{(m)}_{mn}$.
Likewise, $\Ind_{D_{m,n}}^{S_{mn}}(1)$ is naturally isomorphic to the vector space of decompositions of the vertex set $[mn]$ of the complete graph $K_{mn}$ into $n$ disjoint $m$-cycles.
Decomposing these into irreducible representations would allow symmetry reduction of the corresponding combinatorial optimization problems.

We generalize Barbasch and Vogan's proof to recursively describe the decomposition of both $\Ind_{C_{m,n}}^{S_{mn}}(1)$ and $\Ind_{D_{m,n}}^{S_{mn}}(1)$.
We do not believe that a simple pattern for the decomposition exists for $m > 2$ in either case.
However, we are able to establish enough of the structure of $\Ind_{C_{3,n}}^{S_{3n}}(1)$ to show that, unlike the case $m=2$,
the irreducible representations are not multiplicity-free for $n \ge 5$.

The structure of this paper is as follows.
In Section 2, we give a method for determining $\Ind_{C_{m,n}}^{S_{mn}}(1)$ from $\Ind_{C_{m,n-1}}^{S_{m(n-1)}}(1)$.
In Section 3, we produce an explicit linear isomorphism corresponding to the $m=2$ case.
In Section 4, we prove that $\Ind_{C_{m,n}}^{S_{mn}}(1)$ is not multiplicity-free for $n \ge 5$.

\section{Recursive construction}
We generalize the induction step in the proof of Barbasch and Vogan to the cases of $C_{m,n}$ and $D_{m,n}$.
First, we will recall the main ingredients in the case of $B_n$.

\begin{lemma}\label{BV:lemma1}
As homogeneous spaces, 
$S_{2n}/B_n \cong S_{2n-1}/(B_n \cap S_{2n-1}) = S_{2n-1}/B_{n-1}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The second equality follows from $B_n \cap S_{2n-1} = B_{n-1}$.
For the first, define a map $\phi: S_{2n} / B_n \to S_{2n-1}/B_{n-1}$ by $\phi(gB_n) = (gB_n) \cap S_{2n-1}$.
When defining $\phi$, choosing the coset representative $g \in S_{2n-1}$ shows that $\phi$ is well-defined.
It's straightforward to check that the $S_{2n-1}$ action commutes with $\phi$.
\end{proof}

The next step lets us determine $\Ind_{B_n}^{S_{2n}}(1)$ by considering its restriction to $S_{2n-1}$.
Although in general a representation is not uniquely determined by its restriction to a subgroup, we will see that in this case there is enough extra information to determine the decomposition.

\begin{lemma}\label{BV:lemma2}
The following recursive rule holds:
$$\Res_{S_{2n-1}}^{S_{2n}}\left(\Ind_{B_n}^{S_{2n}}(1)\right) = \Ind_{S_{2n-2}}^{S_{2n-1}}\left(\Ind_{B_{n-1}}^{S_{2n-2}}(1)\right).$$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By Lemma \ref{BV:lemma1}, $\Res_{S_{2n-1}}^{S_{2n}}(\Ind_{B_n}^{S_{2n}}(1)) = S_{2n-1}/B_{n-1}$.
But this is just a restatement
of the definition of $ \Ind_{B_{n-1}}^{S_{2n-1}} (1) = \Ind_{S_{2n-2}}^{S_{2n-1}}(\Ind_{B_{n-1}}^{S_{2n-2}}(1))$.
\end{proof}

We will use the original result of Barbasch and Vogan in Section \ref{BV:section3}, so we prove it here for completeness.
Here we say a partition $\lambda \vdash 2n$ is {\em even} if each of its parts $\lambda_i$ is even.

\begin{theorem}\label{BV:theorem1}
The decomposition of $\Ind_{B_n}^{S_{2n}}(1)$ into irreducibles is 
$$\Ind_{B_n}^{S_{2n}}(1) \cong \bigoplus_{\stackrel{\lambda \vdash 2n}{\lambda  \textup{ is even}}} S^\lambda.$$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
This is true for $n=1$.
We use induction.
Assume $\Ind_{B_{n-1}}^{S_{2n-2}}(1)$ has the described decomposition.
We use Lemma \ref{BV:lemma1}.
By the branching rule, $\Ind^{S_{2n-1}}_{S_{2n-2}}(\Ind_{B_{n-1}}^{S_{2n-2}}(1))$ contains each $\mu \vdash 2n-1$ having exactly one odd part, and each such $\mu$ appears once.
Suppose $\Ind_{B_n}^{S_{2n}}(1)$ contains $\lambda$ with at least three rows and at least two odd parts.
Then the restriction of $\lambda$ contains a $\mu$ with at least two odd parts; thus these $\lambda$ do not occur.
To rule out $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$ with $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ odd, note that $(2n)$ occurs in $\Ind_{B_n}^{S_{2n}}(1)$ by Frobenius reciprocity.
Therefore $(2n-1,1)$ can't occur in $\Ind_{B_n}^{S_{2n}}(1)$, as it would contribute a second copy of $(2n-1)$ to $\Ind^{S_{2n-1}}_{S_{2n-2}}(\Ind_{B_{n-1}}^{S_{2n-2}}(1))$.
An induction on $i$ shows that $(2n-i,i)$ occurs in $\Ind_{B_n}^{S_{2n}}(1)$ if and only if $i$ is even.

Finally, consider a $\lambda$ with at least three even odd rows.
Each $\mu$ obtained by deleting a box from $\lambda$ occurs in $\Ind^{S_{2n-1}}_{S_{2n-2}}(\Ind_{B_{n-1}}^{S_{2n-2}}(1))$ exactly once, and a single copy of $\lambda$ in $\Ind_{B_n}^{S_{2n}}(1)$ is the only way remaining to account for these $\mu$.
\end{proof}

We now generalize Lemmas \ref{BV:lemma1} and \ref{BV:lemma2} to the cases of $C_{m,n}$ and $D_{m,n}$.

\begin{lemma}\label{BV:lemma3}
The following two recursive rules hold:
\begin{align*}
\Res_{S_{nm-1}}^{S_{nm}}\left(\Ind_{C_{m,n}}^{S_{mn}}(1)\right) &= \Ind_{S_{(n-1)m} \times S_{m-1}}^{S_{nm-1}}\left(\Ind_{C_{m,n-1}}^{S_{m(n-1)}}(1) \otimes 1\right), \\
\Res_{S_{nm-1}}^{S_{nm}}\left(\Ind_{D_{m,n}}^{S_{mn}}(1)\right) &= \Ind_{S_{(n-1)m} }^{S_{nm-1}}\left(\Ind_{D_{m,n-1}}^{S_{m(n-1)}}(1)\right).
\end{align*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The proof is a straightforward generalization of Lemmas \ref{BV:lemma1} and \ref{BV:lemma2}.
Observe that $C_{m,n} \cap S_{mn-1} = C_{m,n-1} \times S_{m-1}$ and that $D_{m,n} \cap S_{mn-1} = D_{m,n-1}$.
We then have that $S_{mn} / C_{m,n} \cong S_{mn-1} / (C_{m,n-1} \times S_{m-1})$ and 
$S_{mn} / D_{m,n} \cong S_{mn-1} / D_{m,n-1}$.
The results follow.
\end{proof}
If we know the decomposition of $\Ind_{C_{m,n}}^{S_{mn}}(1)$ into irreducibles, we can use Lemma \ref{BV:lemma3} and Pieri's rule to decompose $\Ind_{C_{m,n+1}}^{S_{m(n+1)}}(1)$ into irreducibles.
The same is true for $\Ind_{D_{m,n}}^{S_{mn}}(1)$ and $\Ind_{D_{m,n+1}}^{S_{m(n+1)}}(1)$, except that we use the branching rule.
See Table \ref{BV:table1} for some results for $m=3$ and small $n$.

\section{Explicit isomorphism for $m=2$}\label{BV:section3}
Recall that a {\em matching} in a graph is a set of disjoint edges; we say a matching is a $k$-matching if it consists of $k$ edges.
Take $S$ to be the set of $n$-matchings in $K_{2n}$; these are also known as perfect matchings.
If we let $S_{2n}$ permute the vertices of $K_{2n}$, then $S$ is an $S_{2n}$-set and $\CC[S]$ an $S_{2n}$-module.
Note that $S_{2n}$ acts transitively on $S$.


Fix the matching $s = 12|34|\cdots|2n-1,2n$.
Then the stabilizer of $s$ in $S_{2n}$ is exactly $B_n$ as defined in Section 
\ref{BV:Introduction}.
Then $\Ind_{B_n}^{S_{2n}}(1) \cong \CC[S]$ as $S_{2n}$-modules.
We give an explicit decomposition of $\CC[S]$ into irreducibles; i.e., we provide a concrete linear map from each summand $S^\lambda \to \CC[S]$.
Note that the decomposition is determined up to isomorphism by Theorem \ref{BV:theorem1}.
Our contribution here is to give an effectively computable isomorphism.

\begin{lemma}\label{hyperoctahedral}
Let $S$ be the set of $k$-matchings in $K_{2k}$.
Then $\CC[S] \cong \bigoplus_{\lambda} S^\lambda$, where the direct sum is over all partitions $\lambda$ of $2k$ consisting of even parts.
The multiplicity of each $S^\lambda$ is 1.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Fix an even $\lambda$.
We will define a map $f: M^\lambda \to \CC[S]$.
For a single-row tabloid $R$, let $f(R)$ be the sum of all matchings in $R$.
For a tabloid $T$ with rows $R_i$, let $f(T) = \prod_i f(R_i)$; we interpret the product of disjoint matchings as their union.
For example:
\begin{align*}
 \ytableausetup{tabloids} 
f\left(\ytableaushort{1234}\right) &= 12|34 + 13|24 + 14|23 \\
f\left(\ytableaushort{1234,56}\right) &= f([1234])f([34]) \\ &= (12|34 + 13|24 + 14|23) \cdot (56) \\ &= 12|34|56 + 13|24|56 + 14|23|56
\end{align*}
Extend by linearity to $M^\lambda$.
This is a map of $S_n$-modules, so its restriction to $S^\lambda$ is either 0 or an isomorphism.

Let $t$ be the standard tableau with entries in increasing order.
We will show $f(e_t) \ne 0$.
$f(\{t\})$ contains the term $m=12|34|\cdots|2k-1,2k$.
If $\pm\pi\{t\}$ is another term in $e_t$ such that $f(\pi\{t\})$ also contains $m$, then $2i$ and $2i-1$ must be in the same row of $\pi\{t\}$ for all $i$.
But using column group operations, this is only possible if we switch $2i$ with $2j$ and $2i-1$ with $2j-1$.
Therefore $\pi$ is a product of an even number of disjoint transpositions, and in particular, $\sgn (\pi) = 1$.
So $f(\{t\})$ appears with positive sign in $f(e_t)$, and therefore $f(e_t) \ne 0$.

The proof is completed by noting that, per Theorem \ref{BV:theorem1}, we have accounted for each irreducible representation that appears.
\end{proof}

\section{Multiplicities occur for $m=3, n \ge 5$}
The recursion rules established in Lemma \ref{BV:lemma3} can be used to compute the decompositions of 
$\Ind_{C_{m,n}}^{S_{mn}}(1)$ and 
$\Ind_{D_{m,n}}^{S_{mn}}(1)$ for small values of $m$ and $n$; see Table \ref{BV:table1} at the end of this section.


As discussed above, in all cases we computed, there was a unique
solution to the recursion containing a copy of the trivial representation.
However, unlike the case $m=2$, there does not seem to be any simple pattern to the decomposition.
In particular, the decompositions are not multiplicity-free after the first few values of $n$.

In this section, we consider $V_n := \Ind_{C_{3,n}}^{S_{3n}}(1)$, and determine enough of the structure of $V_n$ to show that
for $n \ge 5$, $V_n$ is not multiplicity-free.
We accomplish this by considering {\em partition patterns}.
A partition pattern $\lambda = (*,\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_k)$ represents any partition of length $k+1$ whose second through last parts equal $\lambda$.
We also abandon tuple notation and simply concatenate digits, as all our entries are at most 9.
For instance, the partition pattern $42$ represents the partition $(n-6,4,2)$ for any $n$.
As a special case, we let $0$ denote the pattern $\emptyset$, representing the partition $(n)$ for any $n$.

For any partition pattern $\lambda$, let $\mult(\lambda,n)$ be the multiplicity of $S^\lambda$ in $V_n$.
Also let $\mult(\lambda,n^-)$ be the multiplicity of $S^\lambda$ in $\Res^{S_{3n}}_{S_{3n-1}}(V_n) = \Ind_{S_{3n-3}}^{S_{3n-1}}(V_{n-1})$.
It is also convenient to refer to $V_n$ and $\Res^{S_{3n}}_{S_{3n-1}}(V_n)$ as {\em level $n$} and {\em level $n^-$}, respectively.

We will first determine the multiplicities of certain $S^\lambda$ in $V_n$.
Then, we will use this structure to show that $V_n$ is not multiplicity-free for
$n \ge 5$.


\begin{lemma}\label{BV:inductivelemma}
The following $\lambda$ have multiplicity $1$ in all levels $n \ge 5$: 
$0,2,3,4,22,5,41,32$.
The following $\lambda$ do not appear in any level: $1,21,31,221,311,411$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
It is easy to check that this holds for $n=5$; see Table \ref{BV:table1}.
Assuming by induction that the
given decomposition holds for $n-1$, we get a partial list of multiplicities
at level $n^-$:


$$
\begin{array}{c||c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c}
\lambda &0&1&11&2&21&3&111&4&31&22&211&1111&5&41&32&311&221 \\ \hline
\mult(\lambda,n^-)&1&1&0&2&1&2&0&3&2&2&0&0&3&3&3&0&1
\end{array}
$$
It is then straightforward to check that
the given decomposition for level $n$ is the only way to recover these multiplicities at level $n^-$.
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem}\label{BV:multiplicities}
All levels $V_n$ for $n \ge 5$ have multiplicities.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
By Lemma \ref{BV:inductivelemma}, it follows that $\mult(51,n) + \mult(42,n) = 2$ for all $n$.
By considering the relevant children at level $n-1$, we can see that $\mult(51,n^-) + \mult(42,n^-) = 9$.
 Therefore, one of
$\mult(51,n^-)$, $\mult(42,n^-) \ge 5$.
But since each of $51$ and $42$ has four parents at
level $n$, we must have multiplicities at level $n$.
\end{proof}
