This is some code and notes supporting an attempt to generalize the following
result (proved by Barbasch and Vogan in (?) 1982):

The action of S_{2n} on the set of complete matchings on K_{2n} is isomorphic
to the sum of S^\lambda over all partitions \lambda of 2n consisting entirely
of even parts. Each such irreducible occurs with multiplicity one.
